# subtitles-fixed
This is a repo filled with subtitles I downloaded from youtube/nebula but added corrections to 

I DO NOT OWN THE COPYRIGHT OF THESE SUBTITLES, NOT IS ANYONE BUT THE CONTENT CREATOR ALLOWED TO USE THEM.

I created this repo purely to easily be able to show what needs to be changed for each video. I noticed a lot of videos subtitles have various flaws in them and even though I've tried to contact many of these content creators, they don't have the time (I assume) to actually look at my emails.

So for now I'm posting them here hopefully for in the future.

Each Pull Request will be for a creator
