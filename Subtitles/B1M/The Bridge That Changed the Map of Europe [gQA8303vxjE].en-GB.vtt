00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:04.240
This bridge should not have been possible.

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:09.520
This is the Millau viaduct in France.&nbsp;
It is the tallest bridge in the world.

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:13.680
In fact all of Europe today there are only four&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:16.040
skyscrapers taller than it, the bridge&nbsp;
is even taller than the Eiffel Tower.

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:22.800
It soars 340 metres above the&nbsp;
Tarn valley for 2.4 kilometres.

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.680
For decades its critics said&nbsp;
it could never be built. When&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:31.800
it was finished it changed the map of&nbsp;
Europe and could be seen from space.

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.400
To build it, the deck had to slide&nbsp;
across seven enormous towers in a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:41.440
technique that was so innovative,&nbsp;
they weren’t sure if it would work.

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:48.080
I was absolutely terrified. I was physically sick&nbsp;
with apprehension. Was it the right decision?&nbsp;

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:53.800
To celebrate the 20th anniversary of the bridge’s&nbsp;
opening we sat down with renowned architect Lord&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:53.800 --> 00:01:01.240
Norman Foster in a special interview to trace&nbsp;
the viaduct’s journey from impossibility to icon.

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:09.400
It's an extraordinary fusion of talents&nbsp;
right across every aspect of society,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:15.560
from the politicians through to the&nbsp;
extraordinary individuals who made it.

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:20.320
Lord Norman Foster is one today’s most&nbsp;
accomplished architects. You may know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.040
some of his other projects:&nbsp;
the Gherkin, the Reichstag,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:31.000
and nearly every famous Apple store,&nbsp;
including of course Apple Park.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.200
His practice continues to define the&nbsp;
skylines of America, London, and Europe.

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:40.200
But it is this project that&nbsp;
may be his most breathtaking.

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:49.280
This is the bridge above the&nbsp;
clouds. The Millau viaduct.

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.320
France has a problem.

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:53.880
This is Massif Central. It is a beautiful,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.960
rugged mountainous terrain that covers&nbsp;
about 15 percent of the country.

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.280
It also severs France in two.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:05.200
These same gorges, rivers and forests make&nbsp;
it an incredibly hard landscape for anyone to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:10.480
cross coming from the north to south of the&nbsp;
country, or from northern Europe to Spain.

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:13.000
For centuries this divided Europe and meant that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.560
central France could not develop due to&nbsp;
a lack of adequate transportation links.

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.960
The roads and trainlines that did exist&nbsp;
were mostly single lane and would have to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:27.560
dip and rise into these steep valleys,&nbsp;
or make massive detours. Many villages&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:31.760
did not have proper connections&nbsp;
to the outside world at all.

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.040
In the summer months those travelling from cities&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:38.160
like Paris to the south of France&nbsp;
would have to come through here.

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:43.240
This is Millau, a picturesque village&nbsp;
surrounded by beautiful countryside.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:48.080
During this time it became the worst&nbsp;
bottleneck in Europe. The congestion&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:54.400
would add 5 hours to any journey and&nbsp;
extend 20 kilometres in both directions.

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:57.320
In the 1980s the French government wanted to solve&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:00.520
this problem. Massive freeways&nbsp;
were built through the region,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:06.240
but the question remained: what to do about&nbsp;
the worst bottleneck. What to do about Millau?

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:12.320
Should the village be bypassed altogether? Should&nbsp;
a bridge be built over the Tarn river? But where?

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:17.280
Geologists and specialists worked for&nbsp;
years to figure out where on earth this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:23.960
bridge could go. The valley was wide and steep&nbsp;
and prone to landslides. It was a nightmare.

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:28.000
Engineer Michel Virlogeux and his&nbsp;
team then had a lightbulb moment:&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:34.360
what if the road didn’t go into the valley at&nbsp;
all? What if the bridge went over it entirely?

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:39.760
It was an incredibly bold idea and something that&nbsp;
had never been done on such a scale before. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:44.720
French government thought Virlogeux was insane and&nbsp;
the bridge was put to rest… for the time being.

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.720
If it hadn’t been for the&nbsp;
success of another bridge,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:52.800
a few hundred miles away, the Milau&nbsp;
Viaduct might never have happened.

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:59.240
Virlogeux was working on the Pont de Normandie&nbsp;
which was completed in 1994. It is an incredible&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:04.640
cable-stayed bridge that crosses the Seine right&nbsp;
before it empties into the ocean. Seeing this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:10.040
bridge convinced the French government that the&nbsp;
Milau Viaduct might just be possible after all.

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:14.400
Virlogeux had one condition. If this bridge&nbsp;
was going to cross the Tarn Gorge it would&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:19.480
have to add to the landscape, not take away&nbsp;
from it. It would have to be beautiful.

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:23.200
This is where architect&nbsp;
Lord Norman Foster came in.

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:29.440
You only get one first impression. And&nbsp;
it was just a meeting of minds. I mean,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:34.520
when we started to engage with each other&nbsp;
and talk about the idea of the competition.

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:39.720
it's rare that you engage with&nbsp;
somebody. And when you're talking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:45.240
issues of structure or aesthetics that&nbsp;
you find you're on the same wavelength.

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:50.080
the chemistry was and is fantastic.

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:55.640
An international competition was held to decide on&nbsp;
the design for the bridge. It was not especially&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:59.640
common for architects to be involved in massive&nbsp;
national infrastructure projects like this.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:03.800
Lord Foster would have to prove his worth.

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:07.360
I think it's very rare. I think the the government&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:11.360
agency that was tasked with&nbsp;
the idea of the competition

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:15.960
realised environmentally it was so&nbsp;
sensitive that there should be from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:22.745
the outset a visual aesthetic&nbsp;
coupling to the engineering.

00:05:22.745 --> 00:05:25.120
It was decided a cable-stayed bridge would be&nbsp;
chosen over other types of bridges, like a more&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:30.640
traditional suspension bridge. Cable-stayed&nbsp;
bridges are more efficient at carrying heavy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:35.960
loads, and they can support a much more&nbsp;
slender deck so it’s much better to look at.

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:40.040
Everything about the viaduct was&nbsp;
to minimise its visual impact.

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:42.360
Lord Foster even reduced the number of piers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:46.349
to seven from the nine that&nbsp;
Virlogeux initially proposed.

00:05:46.349 --> 00:05:46.433
When it came time to present their design&nbsp;
to the jury the team decided to lead with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:46.433 --> 00:05:46.504
Lord Foster. This was very unusual&nbsp;
for a civil infrastructure project,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:46.504 --> 00:05:46.579
especially in France where engineers&nbsp;
are often more famous than architects.

00:05:46.579 --> 00:05:46.676
Interestingly, the engineers in the team insisted&nbsp;
that I present the project. Now, obviously the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:46.676 --> 00:05:46.767
bridge is a work of engineering and I don't&nbsp;
pretend never could profess to be an engineer.

00:05:46.767 --> 00:05:46.857
But the idea that I presented it perhaps came&nbsp;
out of the shared philosophy,to reinterpret&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:46.857 --> 00:05:46.949
the bridge over the Tarn as being a bridge&nbsp;
connecting two plateaus across the entire valley.

00:05:46.949 --> 00:05:47.016
celebrating the heroic proportions&nbsp;
of this great landscape valley,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:47.016 --> 00:05:47.080
that was really a philosophical&nbsp;
decision shared by all the team.

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:51.680
Foster and Virlogeux’s design&nbsp;
won hands down. They proposed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:55.600
something more than just a bridge.&nbsp;
They proposed an extension of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:55.600 --> 00:06:01.920
natural beauty of the valley itself. A&nbsp;
philosophical concept, not just a bridge.

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:08.440
I remember collaborating with Buckminster&nbsp;
Fuller for the last 12 years of his life,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:12.560
and I remember him saying something like,&nbsp;
I never try and make something beautiful,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:19.720
but at the end of the process, if it's&nbsp;
not beautiful, then somehow it's wrong.

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:22.120
Now the real work began.

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:25.920
Once plans for the bridge were officially&nbsp;
announced there was an outcry from locals&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:30.120
and environmentalists. Like Lord Foster,&nbsp;
many feared the natural beauty of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:34.840
landscape would be ruined by a colossal&nbsp;
bridge taller than the Eiffel Tower.

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:37.960
There were also fears that while the&nbsp;
bridge would assuage the bottleneck,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:40.960
it could negatively affect the economy of Millau.

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:45.120
There was now more pressure on Foster&nbsp;
and Virlogeux than ever before.

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:52.840
This enormous, record breaking bridge&nbsp;
would also need to be invisible.

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:56.400
Managing any business can often&nbsp;
feel like an impossible task,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:59.920
it may not be an invisible bridge taller&nbsp;
than any building in Europe, but that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:02.800
doesn’t mean business owners&nbsp;
aren’t reaching for the sky.

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:05.720
That’s where today’s video sponsor Odoo can help.

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:07.920

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:49.600
lost constantly searching your inbox for&nbsp;
that one piece of crucial information.

00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:54.240
While integrated ChatGPT can help you&nbsp;
write emails when you’re in a rush.

00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:58.840
The integrated analytics tool can also easily&nbsp;
track revenue forecasts and team performance,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:01.840
so whether you're producing a YouTube&nbsp;
video or building one of the world’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:06.880
most iconic bridges you know exactly what&nbsp;
stage you’re at, and if you’re on budget.

00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:15.520
The first application is free for&nbsp;
life, so why not try it today.

00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:20.600
Now, let’s get back to the bridge in the clouds…

00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:24.440
At this time, these piers would be taller&nbsp;
than any building in Europe, and they would&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:29.640
be sitting in open fields with no other structure&nbsp;
around them for scale, they would look even more&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:35.840
gigantic. To balance this, Lord Foster&nbsp;
wanted them to disappear into the sky.

00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:42.000
The idea that the column is faceted and&nbsp;
is like a tuning fork and you can see&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:52.000
through it that was simultaneously visually&nbsp;
slimming it, but at the same time responding&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:52.000 --> 00:09:01.080
to the expansion and contraction in&nbsp;
a more economic way. So performance,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:07.040
economy, integrity, optimize&nbsp;
structure all go hand in hand.

00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:11.520
The towers would get more slender as&nbsp;
they rose, dividing into two prongs,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:17.760
more or less halving from 24 metres wide&nbsp;
at the bottom to 11 metres at the top.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:22.160
While this is aesthetically pleasing&nbsp;
it served another purpose as well.

00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:27.840
The Millau Viaduct had another&nbsp;
obstacle to being built: the wind.

00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:33.320
Wind speeds could blow through the Tarn Gorge&nbsp;
at more than 130 miles an hour. The two prongs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:38.280
in each of the piers allowed for the deck above&nbsp;
to move but be stable while the wind could pass&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:45.000
through the gaps. It also allowed for the deck to&nbsp;
expand and contract as metal does on warm days.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.600
This was another example of the&nbsp;
harmonious relationship between&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:51.920
engineering and architecture&nbsp;
that this bridge required.

00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:55.840
But there was a pressing issue that&nbsp;
kept Lord Foster awake at night:&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:58.120
what colour should the bridge be?

00:09:58.120 --> 00:10:01.000
It sounds simple enough, but the&nbsp;
choice could make or break the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:06.920
entire project. The viaduct couldn’t exactly&nbsp;
be bright red like the Golden Gate Bridge.

00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:14.600
“That's not a cosmetic decision.&nbsp;
It has enormous visual impact.

00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:21.200
“If you decide the landscape is&nbsp;
the protagonist is the main player,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:26.080
then that will lead you to&nbsp;
doing those cables dark because.

00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:29.680
“They would disappear into the&nbsp;
landscape, but they would be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:37.440
dominant against the sky. If you make them&nbsp;
light. They would disappear into the sky.”

00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:42.120
Lord Foster realised most people viewing the&nbsp;
viaduct would be looking at it from below,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:45.720
either from the village or from the&nbsp;
deck as they drove across it. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:49.640
bridge would need to blend with the&nbsp;
sky. Not with the valley around it.

00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:52.120
In the end he chose grey.

00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:59.360
“I was absolutely terrified. I was physically&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:07.480
sick with apprehension. Was it the right&nbsp;
decision? It's binary. There's no halfway.”

00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:12.840
Spacing the piers was its own challenge.&nbsp;
They would have to be equidistantly spaced,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:16.800
but also structurally efficient,&nbsp;
buildable, and economical.

00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:26.040
“There's a trade off between the cost of a&nbsp;
span because the longer the span generally,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:31.240
the more expensive it becomes,&nbsp;
but then the shorter the span,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:38.511
the more piers. And each pair has four deep&nbsp;
piles and each pier obviously has a cost.”

00:11:38.511 --> 00:11:38.604
Excessively long spans would create difficulties&nbsp;
and extra costs when constructing the deck,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:38.604 --> 00:11:40.760
yet each pier represented a&nbsp;
massive cost in itself. In the end,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:46.040
the team compromised with a span&nbsp;
of 342 metres in between each pier.

00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:49.280
The piers, each one taller than a skyscraper,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:54.160
then began their construction. GPS technology&nbsp;
was used to place each one. Project engineers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:58.720
sunk these deep into the valley bedrock&nbsp;
and covered them with reinforced concrete.

00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:02.360
The deck was made from hollow steel&nbsp;
and was prefabricated in sections&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:07.400
at the Eiffel factory at Alsace in&nbsp;
eastern France - yes, that Eiffel.

00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:10.560
Each section was then floated down&nbsp;
the Rhine, to the Mediterranean,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:14.760
to the French coast, and then driven&nbsp;
by road to the construction site.

00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:18.600
The deck was then slid across the&nbsp;
completed towers using enormous&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:23.240
hydraulics that pushed them across&nbsp;
the valley a little bit every day.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:28.400
They were launched simultaneously from both&nbsp;
sides over temporary structural supports.

00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:32.040
During this time the weather&nbsp;
had to be closely monitored,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:34.720
strong winds could damage the&nbsp;
deck before it reached the next&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:39.120
supporting tower as each “launching”&nbsp;
operation would take up to three days.

00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:42.160
Even with the GPS technology it wasn’t&nbsp;
a certainty that the deck would meet&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:46.720
in the middle, the piers would line up,&nbsp;
or that the colour was the correct one.

00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:54.680
“Whether it's a bridge or whether it's a&nbsp;
building, we now have more sophisticated&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:54.680 --> 00:12:58.260
means of visualisations. I mean, I've just&nbsp;
come from a design session and I'm wearing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:58.260 --> 00:12:59.240
these goggles and I can see everything&nbsp;
three dimensionally. But the truth is,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:04.240
until you actually see the real&nbsp;
thing, you really don't know.”

00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:09.591
The day the two halves were due to meet was&nbsp;
a nervewracking one for everyone involved.

00:13:09.591 --> 00:13:10.400
A champagne bottle was placed between the deck and&nbsp;
smashed in celebration when they met. In the end&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:13.360
it was with millimetre precision.

00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:16.000
It was only now the architecture and engineering&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:20.640
teams could view their bridge&nbsp;
and see if it was a success.

00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:24.080
“The relief. I can't. I can't tell you.

00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:28.200
“It's only when you come on the approach road.

00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:34.040
“Then wonderfully, you realize&nbsp;
it was the right decision.”

00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:36.360
From the beginning Lord Foster did not want the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:41.160
road to be a simple straight line. He&nbsp;
wanted it to curve over the valley,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:46.000
so that as you drove across it you could&nbsp;
get a true sense of the bridge’s scale.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:54.040
“It's on a 20 kilometre arc. And when you&nbsp;
drive over that bridge and it unfolds,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:59.040
so you're seeing the alignment, you're seeing&nbsp;
the pillars disappearing in perspective.

00:13:59.040 --> 00:13:59.340
“I think without question, it's&nbsp;
a more beautiful expression than&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:59.340 --> 00:13:59.600
literally a one liner. There&nbsp;
is an extraordinary subtlety.

00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:03.440
“The sides are transparent and it's very,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:09.160
very difficult to find a bridge where you&nbsp;
can drive over and you can actually see,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:16.080
you feel you’re on that shelf. So you've got all&nbsp;
the safety, all the protection. But you can see&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:25.680
across. So it's the closest you can get to fly&nbsp;
to when that is literally above the clouds.”

00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:27.960
Far from destroying the economy of Millau,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:33.280
the bridge became an instant icon and tourist&nbsp;
attraction in its own right. Visitors come&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:38.640
far and wide to see the bridge and the&nbsp;
village, but now there is no congestion.

00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:46.800
“When I was last there, somebody came up to&nbsp;
me and said something along the lines of,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:50.240
When you were doing this project, I protested.

00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:53.280
“This individual said, I just want to tell you we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:54.990
were wrong. You know, we just love this building&nbsp;
and everything that it's done for the community.

00:14:54.990 --> 00:14:55.079
“I would like to think that the response,&nbsp;
the way in which it's almost a gravitational&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:55.079 --> 00:14:55.162
magnetic pull where people want to come&nbsp;
see it from a distance, view it experience&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:55.162 --> 00:14:55.243
to drive. I think in a way that's a kind&nbsp;
of vindication of the all the hard work.

00:14:55.243 --> 00:14:55.323
“When you see it's like the tip of the&nbsp;
iceberg. What you don't see is all the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:55.323 --> 00:14:55.400
stages, all the long, hard work, long&nbsp;
hours that's gone into that process.”

00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:58.600
The road opened up this area of France and changed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:58.600 --> 00:15:03.040
the map of Europe. Within three&nbsp;
years the bridge paid for itself.

00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:10.400
The detour also saves around 40,000 tons of&nbsp;
CO2 emissions from heavy goods vehicles alone,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:16.240
the equivalent of 40,000 trees&nbsp;
absorbing emissions over 40 years.

00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:20.880
The viaduct illustrates, perhaps more&nbsp;
than any other, the importance of good&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:25.400
design and of the power of involving&nbsp;
architects in infrastructure projects.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:31.880
That architects and engineers can achieve&nbsp;
remarkable things when working in harmony.

00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:38.040
“It's really important to break down the barriers&nbsp;
between the different parties because in the end,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:47.040
all of these things are in the public domain. And&nbsp;
in my experience, the more views, the better.”

00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:51.080
Because of its beauty the bridge does&nbsp;
not detract from the landscape around it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:55.920
it only adds to it, and&nbsp;
elevates it to new heights.

00:15:55.920 --> 00:15:59.640
“When you look at it. It's&nbsp;
not a work of architecture,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:59.640 --> 00:16:03.832
not a work of engineering.&nbsp;
It's a work of infrastructure.

00:16:03.832 --> 00:16:03.916
“It transcends the function of just getting&nbsp;
from one side of a river to the other.

00:16:03.916 --> 00:16:04.147
“It starts to take on a symbolic quality.&nbsp;
It becomes emblematic of the place.

00:16:04.147 --> 00:16:09.400
“It's unique. You can't compare it with&nbsp;
anything else. I mean, you can talk about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:16.160
buildings and you can say this building or that&nbsp;
building, but there's only one Millau Viaduct.

00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:38.960
“Twenty years later it is&nbsp;
still just as breathtaking.”
