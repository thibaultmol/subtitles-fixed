00:00.960 --> 00:04.240
This bridge should not have been possible.

00:04.240 --> 00:09.520
This is the Millau viaduct in France. 
It is the tallest bridge in the world.

00:09.520 --> 00:13.680
In fact all of Europe today there are only four

00:13.680 --> 00:16.040
skyscrapers taller than it, the bridge 
is even taller than the Eiffel Tower.

00:16.040 --> 00:22.800
It soars 340 metres above the 
Tarn valley for 2.4 kilometres.

00:22.800 --> 00:26.680
For decades its critics said 
it could never be built. When

00:26.680 --> 00:31.800
it was finished it changed the map of 
Europe and could be seen from space.

00:31.800 --> 00:36.400
To build it, the deck had to slide 
across seven enormous towers in a

00:36.400 --> 00:41.440
technique that was so innovative, 
they weren’t sure if it would work.

00:41.440 --> 00:48.080
I was absolutely terrified. I was physically sick 
with apprehension. Was it the right decision?

00:48.080 --> 00:53.800
To celebrate the 20th anniversary of the bridge’s 
opening we sat down with renowned architect Lord

00:53.800 --> 01:01.240
Norman Foster in a special interview to trace 
the viaduct’s journey from impossibility to icon.

01:01.240 --> 01:09.400
It's an extraordinary fusion of talents 
right across every aspect of society,

01:09.400 --> 01:15.560
from the politicians through to the 
extraordinary individuals who made it.

01:15.560 --> 01:20.320
Lord Norman Foster is one today’s most 
accomplished architects. You may know

01:22.360 --> 01:25.040
some of his other projects: 
the Gherkin, the Reichstag,

01:25.040 --> 01:31.000
and nearly every famous Apple store, 
including of course Apple Park.

01:31.000 --> 01:36.200
His practice continues to define the 
skylines of America, London, and Europe.

01:36.200 --> 01:40.200
But it is this project that 
may be his most breathtaking.

01:40.200 --> 01:49.280
This is the bridge above the 
clouds. The Millau viaduct.

01:49.280 --> 01:51.320
France has a problem.

01:51.320 --> 01:53.880
This is Massif Central. It is a beautiful,

01:53.880 --> 01:57.960
rugged mountainous terrain that covers 
about 15 percent of the country.

01:57.960 --> 02:00.280
It also severs France in two.

02:00.280 --> 02:05.200
These same gorges, rivers and forests make 
it an incredibly hard landscape for anyone to

02:05.200 --> 02:10.480
cross coming from the north to south of the 
country, or from northern Europe to Spain.

02:10.480 --> 02:13.000
For centuries this divided Europe and meant that

02:13.000 --> 02:17.560
central France could not develop due to 
a lack of adequate transportation links.

02:17.560 --> 02:21.960
The roads and trainlines that did exist 
were mostly single lane and would have to

02:21.960 --> 02:27.560
dip and rise into these steep valleys, 
or make massive detours. Many villages

02:27.560 --> 02:31.760
did not have proper connections 
to the outside world at all.

02:31.760 --> 02:34.040
In the summer months those travelling from cities

02:34.040 --> 02:38.160
like Paris to the south of France 
would have to come through here.

02:38.160 --> 02:43.240
This is Millau, a picturesque village 
surrounded by beautiful countryside.

02:43.240 --> 02:48.080
During this time it became the worst 
bottleneck in Europe. The congestion

02:48.080 --> 02:54.400
would add 5 hours to any journey and 
extend 20 kilometres in both directions.

02:54.400 --> 02:57.320
In the 1980s the French government wanted to solve

02:57.320 --> 03:00.520
this problem. Massive freeways 
were built through the region,

03:00.520 --> 03:06.240
but the question remained: what to do about 
the worst bottleneck. What to do about Millau?

03:06.240 --> 03:12.320
Should the village be bypassed altogether? Should 
a bridge be built over the Tarn river? But where?

03:13.560 --> 03:17.280
Geologists and specialists worked for 
years to figure out where on earth this

03:17.280 --> 03:23.960
bridge could go. The valley was wide and steep 
and prone to landslides. It was a nightmare.

03:23.960 --> 03:28.000
Engineer Michel Virlogeux and his 
team then had a lightbulb moment:

03:28.000 --> 03:34.360
what if the road didn’t go into the valley at 
all? What if the bridge went over it entirely?

03:34.360 --> 03:39.760
It was an incredibly bold idea and something that 
had never been done on such a scale before. The

03:39.760 --> 03:44.720
French government thought Virlogeux was insane and 
the bridge was put to rest… for the time being.

03:45.280 --> 03:47.720
If it hadn’t been for the 
success of another bridge,

03:47.720 --> 03:52.800
a few hundred miles away, the Milau 
Viaduct might never have happened.

03:52.800 --> 03:59.240
Virlogeux was working on the Pont de Normandie 
which was completed in 1994. It is an incredible

03:59.240 --> 04:04.640
cable-stayed bridge that crosses the Seine right 
before it empties into the ocean. Seeing this

04:04.640 --> 04:10.040
bridge convinced the French government that the 
Milau Viaduct might just be possible after all.

04:10.040 --> 04:14.400
Virlogeux had one condition. If this bridge 
was going to cross the Tarn Gorge it would

04:14.400 --> 04:19.480
have to add to the landscape, not take away 
from it. It would have to be beautiful.

04:19.480 --> 04:23.200
This is where architect 
Lord Norman Foster came in.

04:23.200 --> 04:29.440
You only get one first impression. And 
it was just a meeting of minds. I mean,

04:29.440 --> 04:34.520
when we started to engage with each other 
and talk about the idea of the competition.

04:34.520 --> 04:39.720
it's rare that you engage with 
somebody. And when you're talking

04:39.720 --> 04:45.240
issues of structure or aesthetics that 
you find you're on the same wavelength.

04:45.240 --> 04:50.080
the chemistry was and is fantastic.

04:50.080 --> 04:55.640
An international competition was held to decide on 
the design for the bridge. It was not especially

04:55.640 --> 04:59.640
common for architects to be involved in massive 
national infrastructure projects like this.

05:00.400 --> 05:03.800
Lord Foster would have to prove his worth.

05:03.800 --> 05:07.360
I think it's very rare. I think the the government

05:07.360 --> 05:11.360
agency that was tasked with 
the idea of the competition

05:11.360 --> 05:15.960
realised environmentally it was so 
sensitive that there should be from

05:15.960 --> 05:22.745
the outset a visual aesthetic 
coupling to the engineering.

05:22.745 --> 05:25.120
It was decided a cable-stayed bridge would be 
chosen over other types of bridges, like a more

05:25.120 --> 05:30.640
traditional suspension bridge. Cable-stayed 
bridges are more efficient at carrying heavy

05:30.640 --> 05:35.960
loads, and they can support a much more 
slender deck so it’s much better to look at.

05:35.960 --> 05:40.040
Everything about the viaduct was 
to minimise its visual impact.

05:40.040 --> 05:42.360
Lord Foster even reduced the number of piers

05:42.360 --> 05:46.349
to seven from the nine that 
Virlogeux initially proposed.

05:46.349 --> 05:46.433
When it came time to present their design 
to the jury the team decided to lead with

05:46.433 --> 05:46.504
Lord Foster. This was very unusual 
for a civil infrastructure project,

05:46.504 --> 05:46.579
especially in France where engineers 
are often more famous than architects.

05:46.579 --> 05:46.676
Interestingly, the engineers in the team insisted 
that I present the project. Now, obviously the

05:46.676 --> 05:46.767
bridge is a work of engineering and I don't 
pretend never could profess to be an engineer.

05:46.767 --> 05:46.857
But the idea that I presented it perhaps came 
out of the shared philosophy,to reinterpret

05:46.857 --> 05:46.949
the bridge over the Tarn as being a bridge 
connecting two plateaus across the entire valley.

05:46.949 --> 05:47.016
celebrating the heroic proportions 
of this great landscape valley,

05:47.016 --> 05:47.080
that was really a philosophical 
decision shared by all the team.

05:47.080 --> 05:51.680
Foster and Virlogeux’s design 
won hands down. They proposed

05:51.680 --> 05:55.600
something more than just a bridge. 
They proposed an extension of the

05:55.600 --> 06:01.920
natural beauty of the valley itself. A 
philosophical concept, not just a bridge.

06:01.920 --> 06:08.440
I remember collaborating with Buckminster 
Fuller for the last 12 years of his life,

06:08.440 --> 06:12.560
and I remember him saying something like, 
I never try and make something beautiful,

06:12.560 --> 06:19.720
but at the end of the process, if it's 
not beautiful, then somehow it's wrong.

06:19.720 --> 06:22.120
Now the real work began.

06:22.120 --> 06:25.920
Once plans for the bridge were officially 
announced there was an outcry from locals

06:25.920 --> 06:30.120
and environmentalists. Like Lord Foster, 
many feared the natural beauty of the

06:30.120 --> 06:34.840
landscape would be ruined by a colossal 
bridge taller than the Eiffel Tower.

06:34.840 --> 06:37.960
There were also fears that while the 
bridge would assuage the bottleneck,

06:37.960 --> 06:40.960
it could negatively affect the economy of Millau.

06:40.960 --> 06:45.120
There was now more pressure on Foster 
and Virlogeux than ever before.

06:45.120 --> 06:52.840
This enormous, record breaking bridge 
would also need to be invisible.

06:52.840 --> 06:56.400
Managing any business can often 
feel like an impossible task,

06:56.400 --> 06:59.920
it may not be an invisible bridge taller 
than any building in Europe, but that

06:59.920 --> 07:02.800
doesn’t mean business owners 
aren’t reaching for the sky.

07:02.800 --> 07:05.720
That’s where today’s video sponsor Odoo can help.

07:05.720 --> 07:07.920
To achieve your own impossible dream you’ll need

07:07.920 --> 07:11.680
Oddo’s all-in-one management software 
that can keep track of invoicing,

07:11.680 --> 07:15.680
accounting, project management, inventory, 
website creation and everything else.

07:15.680 --> 07:23.360
Odoo’s CRM application is an extensive tool that 
helps you manage all your business needs. With it,

07:26.160 --> 07:30.600
you can easily track your leads, get accurate 
forecasts, and most importantly close that sale.

07:30.600 --> 07:32.360
Odoo’s communication and tracking 
makes it easy to schedule calls,

07:32.360 --> 07:34.520
meetings, to-do lists, mailings, 
or sending out quotes to clients.

07:36.960 --> 07:41.680
Both incoming emails and internal exchanges 
are done from the same place as well so you

07:41.680 --> 07:45.160
can access your entire decision 
history at any time and not get

07:45.160 --> 07:49.600
lost constantly searching your inbox for 
that one piece of crucial information.

07:49.600 --> 07:54.240
While integrated ChatGPT can help you 
write emails when you’re in a rush.

07:54.240 --> 07:58.840
The integrated analytics tool can also easily 
track revenue forecasts and team performance,

07:58.840 --> 08:01.840
so whether you're producing a YouTube 
video or building one of the world’s

08:01.840 --> 08:06.880
most iconic bridges you know exactly what 
stage you’re at, and if you’re on budget.

08:07.600 --> 08:15.520
The first application is free for 
life, so why not try it today.

08:15.520 --> 08:20.600
Now, let’s get back to the bridge in the clouds…

08:20.600 --> 08:24.440
At this time, these piers would be taller 
than any building in Europe, and they would

08:24.440 --> 08:29.640
be sitting in open fields with no other structure 
around them for scale, they would look even more

08:29.640 --> 08:35.840
gigantic. To balance this, Lord Foster 
wanted them to disappear into the sky.

08:35.840 --> 08:42.000
The idea that the column is faceted and 
is like a tuning fork and you can see

08:42.000 --> 08:52.000
through it that was simultaneously visually 
slimming it, but at the same time responding

08:52.000 --> 09:01.080
to the expansion and contraction in 
a more economic way. So performance,

09:01.080 --> 09:07.040
economy, integrity, optimize 
structure all go hand in hand.

09:07.040 --> 09:11.520
The towers would get more slender as 
they rose, dividing into two prongs,

09:11.520 --> 09:17.760
more or less halving from 24 metres wide 
at the bottom to 11 metres at the top.

09:17.760 --> 09:22.160
While this is aesthetically pleasing 
it served another purpose as well.

09:22.160 --> 09:27.840
The Millau Viaduct had another 
obstacle to being built: the wind.

09:27.840 --> 09:33.320
Wind speeds could blow through the Tarn Gorge 
at more than 130 miles an hour. The two prongs

09:33.320 --> 09:38.280
in each of the piers allowed for the deck above 
to move but be stable while the wind could pass

09:38.280 --> 09:45.000
through the gaps. It also allowed for the deck to 
expand and contract as metal does on warm days.

09:45.000 --> 09:48.600
This was another example of the 
harmonious relationship between

09:48.600 --> 09:51.920
engineering and architecture 
that this bridge required.

09:51.920 --> 09:55.840
But there was a pressing issue that 
kept Lord Foster awake at night:

09:55.840 --> 09:58.120
what colour should the bridge be?

09:58.120 --> 10:01.000
It sounds simple enough, but the 
choice could make or break the

10:01.000 --> 10:06.920
entire project. The viaduct couldn’t exactly 
be bright red like the Golden Gate Bridge.

10:06.920 --> 10:14.600
“That's not a cosmetic decision. 
It has enormous visual impact.

10:14.600 --> 10:21.200
“If you decide the landscape is 
the protagonist is the main player,

10:21.200 --> 10:26.080
then that will lead you to 
doing those cables dark because.

10:26.080 --> 10:29.680
“They would disappear into the 
landscape, but they would be

10:29.680 --> 10:37.440
dominant against the sky. If you make them 
light. They would disappear into the sky.”

10:37.440 --> 10:42.120
Lord Foster realised most people viewing the 
viaduct would be looking at it from below,

10:42.120 --> 10:45.720
either from the village or from the 
deck as they drove across it. The

10:45.720 --> 10:49.640
bridge would need to blend with the 
sky. Not with the valley around it.

10:49.640 --> 10:52.120
In the end he chose grey.

10:52.120 --> 10:59.360
“I was absolutely terrified. I was physically

10:59.360 --> 11:07.480
sick with apprehension. Was it the right 
decision? It's binary. There's no halfway.”

11:07.480 --> 11:12.840
Spacing the piers was its own challenge. 
They would have to be equidistantly spaced,

11:12.840 --> 11:16.800
but also structurally efficient, 
buildable, and economical.

11:16.800 --> 11:26.040
“There's a trade off between the cost of a 
span because the longer the span generally,

11:26.040 --> 11:31.240
the more expensive it becomes, 
but then the shorter the span,

11:31.240 --> 11:38.511
the more piers. And each pair has four deep 
piles and each pier obviously has a cost.”

11:38.511 --> 11:38.604
Excessively long spans would create difficulties 
and extra costs when constructing the deck,

11:38.604 --> 11:40.760
yet each pier represented a 
massive cost in itself. In the end,

11:40.760 --> 11:46.040
the team compromised with a span 
of 342 metres in between each pier.

11:46.040 --> 11:49.280
The piers, each one taller than a skyscraper,

11:49.280 --> 11:54.160
then began their construction. GPS technology 
was used to place each one. Project engineers

11:54.160 --> 11:58.720
sunk these deep into the valley bedrock 
and covered them with reinforced concrete.

11:58.720 --> 12:02.360
The deck was made from hollow steel 
and was prefabricated in sections

12:02.360 --> 12:07.400
at the Eiffel factory at Alsace in 
eastern France - yes, that Eiffel.

12:07.400 --> 12:10.560
Each section was then floated down 
the Rhine, to the Mediterranean,

12:10.560 --> 12:14.760
to the French coast, and then driven 
by road to the construction site.

12:14.760 --> 12:18.600
The deck was then slid across the 
completed towers using enormous

12:18.600 --> 12:23.240
hydraulics that pushed them across 
the valley a little bit every day.

12:23.240 --> 12:28.400
They were launched simultaneously from both 
sides over temporary structural supports.

12:28.400 --> 12:32.040
During this time the weather 
had to be closely monitored,

12:32.040 --> 12:34.720
strong winds could damage the 
deck before it reached the next

12:34.720 --> 12:39.120
supporting tower as each “launching” 
operation would take up to three days.

12:39.120 --> 12:42.160
Even with the GPS technology it wasn’t 
a certainty that the deck would meet

12:42.160 --> 12:46.720
in the middle, the piers would line up, 
or that the colour was the correct one.

12:46.720 --> 12:54.680
“Whether it's a bridge or whether it's a 
building, we now have more sophisticated

12:54.680 --> 12:58.260
means of visualisations. I mean, I've just 
come from a design session and I'm wearing

12:58.260 --> 12:59.240
these goggles and I can see everything 
three dimensionally. But the truth is,

12:59.240 --> 13:04.240
until you actually see the real 
thing, you really don't know.”

13:04.240 --> 13:09.591
The day the two halves were due to meet was 
a nervewracking one for everyone involved.

13:09.591 --> 13:10.400
A champagne bottle was placed between the deck and 
smashed in celebration when they met. In the end

13:10.400 --> 13:13.360
it was with millimetre precision.

13:13.360 --> 13:16.000
It was only now the architecture and engineering

13:16.000 --> 13:20.640
teams could view their bridge 
and see if it was a success.

13:20.640 --> 13:24.080
“The relief. I can't. I can't tell you.

13:24.080 --> 13:28.200
“It's only when you come on the approach road.

13:28.200 --> 13:34.040
“Then wonderfully, you realize 
it was the right decision.”

13:34.040 --> 13:36.360
From the beginning Lord Foster did not want the

13:36.360 --> 13:41.160
road to be a simple straight line. He 
wanted it to curve over the valley,

13:41.160 --> 13:46.000
so that as you drove across it you could 
get a true sense of the bridge’s scale.

13:46.000 --> 13:54.040
“It's on a 20 kilometre arc. And when you 
drive over that bridge and it unfolds,

13:54.040 --> 13:59.040
so you're seeing the alignment, you're seeing 
the pillars disappearing in perspective.

13:59.040 --> 13:59.340
“I think without question, it's 
a more beautiful expression than

13:59.340 --> 13:59.600
literally a one liner. There 
is an extraordinary subtlety.

13:59.600 --> 14:03.440
“The sides are transparent and it's very,

14:03.440 --> 14:09.160
very difficult to find a bridge where you 
can drive over and you can actually see,

14:09.160 --> 14:16.080
you feel you’re on that shelf. So you've got all 
the safety, all the protection. But you can see

14:16.080 --> 14:25.680
across. So it's the closest you can get to fly 
to when that is literally above the clouds.”

14:25.680 --> 14:27.960
Far from destroying the economy of Millau,

14:27.960 --> 14:33.280
the bridge became an instant icon and tourist 
attraction in its own right. Visitors come

14:33.280 --> 14:38.640
far and wide to see the bridge and the 
village, but now there is no congestion.

14:38.640 --> 14:46.800
“When I was last there, somebody came up to 
me and said something along the lines of,

14:46.800 --> 14:50.240
When you were doing this project, I protested.

14:50.240 --> 14:53.280
“This individual said, I just want to tell you we

14:53.280 --> 14:54.990
were wrong. You know, we just love this building 
and everything that it's done for the community.

14:54.990 --> 14:55.079
“I would like to think that the response, 
the way in which it's almost a gravitational

14:55.079 --> 14:55.162
magnetic pull where people want to come 
see it from a distance, view it experience

14:55.162 --> 14:55.243
to drive. I think in a way that's a kind 
of vindication of the all the hard work.

14:55.243 --> 14:55.323
“When you see it's like the tip of the 
iceberg. What you don't see is all the

14:55.323 --> 14:55.400
stages, all the long, hard work, long 
hours that's gone into that process.”

14:55.400 --> 14:58.600
The road opened up this area of France and changed

14:58.600 --> 15:03.040
the map of Europe. Within three 
years the bridge paid for itself.

15:03.040 --> 15:10.400
The detour also saves around 40,000 tons of 
CO2 emissions from heavy goods vehicles alone,

15:10.400 --> 15:16.240
the equivalent of 40,000 trees 
absorbing emissions over 40 years.

15:16.240 --> 15:20.880
The viaduct illustrates, perhaps more 
than any other, the importance of good

15:20.880 --> 15:25.400
design and of the power of involving 
architects in infrastructure projects.

15:26.040 --> 15:31.880
That architects and engineers can achieve 
remarkable things when working in harmony.

15:31.880 --> 15:38.040
“It's really important to break down the barriers 
between the different parties because in the end,

15:38.040 --> 15:47.040
all of these things are in the public domain. And 
in my experience, the more views, the better.”

15:47.040 --> 15:51.080
Because of its beauty the bridge does 
not detract from the landscape around it,

15:51.080 --> 15:55.920
it only adds to it, and 
elevates it to new heights.

15:55.920 --> 15:59.640
“When you look at it. It's 
not a work of architecture,

15:59.640 --> 16:03.832
not a work of engineering. 
It's a work of infrastructure.

16:03.832 --> 16:03.916
“It transcends the function of just getting 
from one side of a river to the other.

16:03.916 --> 16:04.147
“It starts to take on a symbolic quality. 
It becomes emblematic of the place.

16:04.147 --> 16:09.400
“It's unique. You can't compare it with 
anything else. I mean, you can talk about

16:09.400 --> 16:16.160
buildings and you can say this building or that 
building, but there's only one Millau Viaduct.

16:16.160 --> 16:38.960
“Twenty years later it is 
still just as breathtaking.”
